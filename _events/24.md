## Event cancelled

Per the decision by the Berlin senate to [cancel all public academia events](https://www.berlin.de/sen/wissenschaft/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/2020/pressemitteilung.905804.php) as a public health measure. Currently no new date available.

## Berlin Vs Amazon

It could be the physical dimensions of the tower, the fact that it is standing right next to a half-empty shopping mall… Or is it because of the street protests and strikes of Amazon workers fighting for wages and basic safety conditions?  Amazon is expanding its presence in Berlin, and neighborhood residents are fighting back. In this workshop we want to create a space where we can ask ourselves, what it is we are fighting for? On the margins of labor rights, gentrification, tech-lash and activism, what are the strategies that will bring us forward when it comes to creating a long lasting and livable city for all?

One end goal of this workshop is to bring people of different backgrounds and knowledge to produce tangible and actionable research that can be further developed in future activist campaigns and research.

Do not worry if registration is closed, please attend! [Weizenbaum Institute workshops](https://sovereignty.weizenbaum-institut.de/workshops)
