## Tech Workers Coalition Berlin
Tech Workers have a lot of potential power to change society. Anyone who identifies as a _tech worker_ and is interested in learning how to build collective power or get involved in a campaign is welcome.

### Group Activity: Map Your Workplace
Worksheet available [here](https://www.labornotes.org/sites/default/files/33DrawYourWorkplaceMap_0.pdf)

Group exercise with focus on the physical work space and drawing its layout to discover how this might affect worker solidarity and organizing

Some insights from the meeting group:
 - Note the distribution and location of managers
 - Lots of tech companies with a love for glass walls
 - Divisions in the workplace: by gender, race, German vs. non-German, between relatively privileged developers and other colleagues (e.g. call center, marketing, etc...)
 - Ways to spot allies: listen for conflicts/ complaints during breaks, notice responses to complaints at open meetings
 - Good locations for open discussion: away from managers, in large group settings, in the kitchen or other casual break spaces
 - Bad locations for open discussion: near managers' desks/offices, where conversations can be overheard through open windows in open office spaces

Ideas for a future group activity?
 - Abstract mapping of the workplace by social/ power networks
