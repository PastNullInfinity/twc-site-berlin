There are alternatives to the classic managerial company: Coops and Syndicates.

Owned and managed by the people who work there, coops offer an alternative model to the founding of a top-down company, dominated by a small group of executives or by the demands of investors.

With widely available digital tools, tech and game workers are in the unique position to come together and create their own enterprises.

This talk by Magdalena Ziomek aims to provide an introduction for tech workers and game developers interested in the creation of their own coops. Magdalena Ziomek will talk about her own coop, [SMartDe](https://smart-eg.de/en/) and her experiences with building and leading such an enterprise. Created as a "platform coop", SMartDe offers a cooperative alternative to the gig economy. Founded 1998 in Belgium, it acts as an employer for freelancers who can thus leverage benefits that are usually reserved for non-freelance workers, offering flexible and self-determined work schedules instead of precarious freelance jobs.

Presented in collaboration with Berlin Tech Workers Coalition and [Game Workers Unite Germany](https://twitter.com/GWU_Deutschland).

The talk will be held in English.
