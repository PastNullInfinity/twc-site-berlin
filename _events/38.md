## Mapping the Tech Workers of Berlin

Berlin Tech Workers Coalition, in partnership with Werkstatt fÃ¼r Bewegungsbildung, would like to understand better the lives of tech workers, both in our workplace and outside. As part of the eventâ€™s purpose, we also want to familiarize everyone with mapping â€” an important movement building practice.

## Schedule

* 12:00 â€” Brief introduction
* 14:00 â€” Wrap up, and if time/energy permits, have a social hangout online

## Learning Objectives:

1. Develop a more coherent picture and quantitatively grounded image of the problems that face tech workers both in the workplace and in the community,
2. Create a space to interpret the social world they live and play in in order to see how this living space can be politically activated
3. Provide participants with the knowledge to use mapping for future projects and struggles.
4. Identify political issues that motivate tech workers.

As part of the TWC's mission to fight for the rights of tech workers, we need to better know the issues that confront tech workers here in Berlin, and get a better idea of what all the different tech workers need and desire.

If youâ€™re not Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerburg, the only way ordinary people and workers can develop power to change things is through organizing their collective strength. While this sounds to most people like a very obvious thing, where to find that collective strength is something else altogether. Mapping allows participants a way to visualize the base of their concern and map its latent and overt political tendencies in relation to the structures they inhabit. Mapping is a way of categorizing social struggle through a spatial lens.
