Between February 19-21 we will improve documentation of topics related to wider Labour movement and tech labour organizing specifically. The scope is quite broad and there will be mentors to help with first time editors! No matter your skills, whether it's copy editing, photography, researching external articles, there's a place for you! See the full details at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Organized_Labour/Online_edit-a-thon_Tech_February_2021

No registration is not mandatory.

This is the online Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon organised by Berlin chapter of [Tech Workers Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Workers_Coalition "Tech Workers Coalition") to improve coverage of [Trade unions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_unions "Trade unions"), [Works council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_council "Works council")'s and [Labour disputes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_disputes "Labour disputes") particularly in the technology sector. Two of several [Wiki Projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_Projects "Wiki Projects") relevant to this are [WP:LABOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:LABOR "Wikipedia:LABOR") and [WP:TECHNOLOGY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:TECHNOLOGY "Wikipedia:TECHNOLOGY"). Last February 2020, NYC Chapter of [Tech Workers Coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Workers_Coalition "Tech Workers Coalition") organized an edit-a-thon which you can find here: [Meetup/NYC/Tech_Workers_Coalition_NYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/NYC/Tech_Workers_Coalition_NYC "Wikipedia:Meetup/NYC/Tech Workers Coalition NYC")
