## Friday, 19.2. – Sunday, 21.2.

Between February 19 – 21 we will improve documentation of topics related to wider Labour movement and tech labour organizing specifically. The scope is quite broad and there will be mentors to help with first time editors! No matter your skills, whether it's copy editing, photography, researching external articles, there's a place for you! See the full details in the [Wikipedia Event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Organized_Labour/Online_edit-a-thon_Tech_February_2021).

No registration is not mandatory.

The event will be entirely online and consist of a mix of joint meetings and self-paced editing work. The joint meetings to discuss and coordinate over the weekend will be held on Zoom (see the *Schedule* below):
