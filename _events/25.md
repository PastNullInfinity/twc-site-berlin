[Disruption Network Lab -- Evicted By Greed](https://www.disruptionlab.org/evicted-by-greed)

"...an unlikely coalition of anti-gentrification activists, artists, labour organisers, and tech workers have been mobilising together to fight the Amazon tower that is to be completed in 2023 in the area of Berlin-Friedrichshain. Due to property tech speculation, and tech entry into real estate market, Berlin has already seen the fastest increase in housing prices globally over the last five years. Berlin vs. Amazon aims to replicate the success stories of New York‚Äôs ouster of Amazon in 2019, and Berlin‚Äôs recent push back against a Google Campus in Kreuzberg. Yonatan Miller, a member of the Tech Workers Coalition and Berlin vs. Amazon, will discuss the challenges and prospects of such an alliance, presenting their strategy for the struggle ahead."
