This event is open for anyone interested in editing WikiProject Organized Labour. 

This online session in particular is geared towards new editors who come from wider labour academic and activist community. [We organized an event in 2021 just focused on tech and labor](https://netzpolitik.org/2021/digital-unionism-generally-is-quite-new/), but this edit-a-thon will be broader since all worker struggles are important! 

* Registration over Zoom is mandatory: <https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUtceqhrzstHNAaJEjSvkX8ctCAYnt9s7-q>
