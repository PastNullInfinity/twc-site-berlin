## Berlin Vs Amazon

On March 9th, Berlin Vs Amazon hosts our regular open meeting at 19:30 at Temporaum. At the meeting you can learn about the situation with the tower, get in contact with people from BerlinVsAmazon, learn about various actions and get involved. Additionally we'll discuss the different motivations and goals of the people at the meeting. We'd love to meet you and hear your ideas! See you then, hope you join us!
