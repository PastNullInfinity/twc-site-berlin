**Organizing for Power (O4P)** is an online training and networking program for organizers worldwide. More than 10,000 workers from 6 continents and 70 countries have joined O4P trainings in the past 18 months.

**Workers Rising Everywhere** is the fourth training in the O4P series led by labor organizer and educator [Jane McAlevey](https://janemcalevey.com/), and hosted by the [Rosa Luxemburg Foundation](https://www.rosalux.de/en/o4p). This training series focuses on building large (super!) majorities in settings such as workplaces, unions, and housing complexes in order to win the toughest campaigns and organizing battles.

This training features new trainers and inspiring campaign stories from around the world. Using mixed methodologies and small-group sessions, participants will focus on developing core organizing skills including: leader identification, 1-on-1 conversations, charting, and structure tests.
