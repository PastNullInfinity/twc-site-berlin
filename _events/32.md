German labor law is confusing as is, but management's chaotic handling of the pandemic only exacerbates the confusion, particularly for newly arrived Berliners. The number of questions only keeps growing.

![Lawyers Gilsbach and Weidmann](/assets/img/gilsbach_und_weidmann.jpg)

- Is there a right to work from home if I donâ€™t feel safe at work anymore?
- Can the employer make me work from home against my will?
- How are sick leave and holiday leave handled now?
- What does "Kurzarbeit" mean? How does it work? Can the employer just send me home and stop paying me? -
- Do I have to apply for Kurzarbeitergeld myself or does the employer have to do this for me?
- How does my social security (especially my foreign/German health care) work now?
- Is this a good time to elect a works council at work? Is it even possible now?

All of these questions and more are addressed by lawyers [Anna Gilsbach](https://dka-kanzlei.de/gilsbach.html) (social security) and [Daniel Weidmann](https://dka-kanzlei.de/weidmann.html) (employment).

The presentation will take an hour, with an additional hour for questions and answers.
