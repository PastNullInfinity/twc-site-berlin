[Registration](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYsfuqupzwiGtz1g9GM5VZVpy5gVOJW2UCt) for this session is mandatory to ensure a safe environment for everyone. These trainings are held monthly.

## Accessibility

The event will be held over Zoom, a video conferencing platform. You can use Zoom with your desktop, laptop, or mobile device.

You need an internet connection and speakers to listen, and a microphone (and optionally camera) to participate. You can also join the conversation via the (written) chat.

There will be a brief presentation with static slides, but most of the event will be audio-based discussion in English.
