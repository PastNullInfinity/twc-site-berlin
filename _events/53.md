A decade after the dispersion of ‹gig work› companies around the world, many of their workers have organized protests, strikes and legal action. More recently, employed tech workers have also organized together. This development raises questions about possible coalitions between both groups, who are often working for the same company under very different conditions.

However, several issues might complicate a common struggle. The dissolution of a common workplace, but also class positions, race or gender might present hurdles. Are coalitions between both groups possible, and under what conditions can they succeed? We will discuss these issues in gig and tech work in the field of urban mobility.
