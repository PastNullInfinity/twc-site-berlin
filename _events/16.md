## A beginner friendly introduction to forming a Works Council (Betriebsrat) in your workplace
Do you want more say in how your workplace is run - from working hours to trainings and challenging layoffs? Sounds great? So why donâ€™t you try it at work?

Germany has a robust legal framework to elect works councils to collectively improve working conditions and legally protect its members from dismissal or other hardship at the workplace. Yet many Berlin tech workers still hesitate to start an election at their workplaces. Some confuse it with trade union activism, others are wary of dealing with the many legal regulations and struggle with the lack of translated handbooks.

Our event aims at clarifying what is required to elect a works council, how it can be used to ameliorate your conditions of work, how much effort this means for activists and how it is related to what German trade unions do at the workplace.

The event is free and open to the public. It is hosted by Berlin Tech Workers Coalition and Werkstatt Bewegung. After a PowerPoint presentation, there will be planned time to ask questions and socialize with drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic). The event will be conducted in English and is open to all Tech and non Tech Workers (TNT) ðŸ§¨ free of charge. Contact us at hello@techworkersberlin.com if you have any questions!
