## Tech Workers Coalition Berlin - Learning Club
Learning is central to workers' empowerment. Without knowledge on the complex world we operate in, we are prey to the interests of those who capitalize on exploitation. Tech Worker Coalition organizes regular sessions in the form of reading groups to read and discuss articles, books and pamphlets about a variety of topics that sit on the boundary between technology critique, politics, philosophy and sociology. The role of the Tech Worker, the possible strategies and the history of worker organizations are also targets to our work.


In this third session we will focus on Worker's Inquiry, a tool with a long history that has been used and reshaped many times since its inception in the 19th century. Tech Worker Coalition uses it extensively and in many different forms. The goal of this session is to understand it better as a tool in order to use it more effectively in our day-to-day strategy.

There are two readings for this month:

* [Workers' Inquiry: A Genealogy](https://www.viewpointmag.com/2013/09/27/workers-inquiry-a-genealogy/)
* [Looking back](https://notesfrombelow.org/article/looking-back)

## How to participate

The easiest way to participate is to just show up at the event having read the material for the given session.

If you want to have a more interactive experience though, we have a Slack group and a [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/TechWorkersBER/) in which we might publish some additional readings for the more passionate participants.
